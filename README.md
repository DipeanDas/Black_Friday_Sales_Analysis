# Black_Friday_Sales_Analysis
This project is all about the analysis of the Black Friday sales Data using python libraries with a view to bringing insights from data for businessmen.
Black Friday is a shopperâ€™s delight. It is a day full of special shopping deals and big discounts and is considered the beginning of the holiday shopping season. 
On the flipside, businesses look at this day as an opportunity to win new customers, boost sales, and increase profits.
To make the most of the Black Friday sale, business owners can look at past data. That way, they can decide which products to offer at high discounts, which demographics to market to, and more. 
To cater to the needs, the dataset was analysed to find a solution to existing drawbacks and also to find the scopes of improvement/updation.
Language Used: Python
